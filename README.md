# World_Weather_Analysis
Introduction:
In this Task We will be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of Multiple cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. For Achieving this, we will be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMapAPI, to create a representative model of weather across world cities.


Objectives:
our objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
•	Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
•	Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
•	Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
•	Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Requirements:
•	You must use Matplot library to create your plots.
•	You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
•	You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.


Conclusions:
While using the OpenweathermapAPI to determine the weather for cities around the world, I noticed a few things which are. In the Temperature vs. Latitude scatter plot, as the latitude increases the temperature increases. In the Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude scatter plot, the average when speed for all cities is fairly low. The wind speeds are higher on average at the north and south poles
